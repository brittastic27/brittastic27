# Hi, I’m Brittney 👋

🎓 Computer Science sophomore at Princeton University  

🎨 Interested in HCI, UI/UX design, product design, frontend & full-stack dev, web & mobile dev, and video games  

🧩 I enjoy building interactive, user-centered software and learning by doing. I'm interested in exploring frontend frameworks and modern web and mobile app development

🎯 Fun fact: I spent summer '25 in Tokyo, Japan working at an IT consulting and web services company (I also explored, ate a lot of 7/11, and learned a bit of basic Japanese)
